<body>  <p>  
    In javascript,they both are related to memory space and there is 
    a very simple difference between them .If the variable name which is 
    being accessed doesn't exist in memory space then it would be not defined 
    ,and if exists in memory space but hasn't been assigned any value 
    till now,then it would be undefined.
